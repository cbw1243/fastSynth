# fastSynth

# Description  
This code provides fast computation of the synthetical control method. Authors: Bowen Chen (PhD candidate in Agricultural Economics at Kansas State University; Email: bwchen@ksu.edu), Huayan Geng (PhD candidate in Economics, SUNY Binghamton University; Email: hgeng1@binghamton.edu). Feel free to contact us if you encounter any question using our functions. 


### Version 1:
This version uses the nloptr package for optimization instead of the optimx package. Computation time is reduced by around 5 times at a Windows computer.   

# Direction

### Version 1:  
Download the "fastSynthV1_NLopt.r" function (or copy and paste) to a R script in your computer. Run the function in R, and then use it like synth function from the Synth package. You can also download the "fastSynthV1_NLoptTest.r" and run the Part 1 and Part 3 in the script.
